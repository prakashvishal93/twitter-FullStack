                    <p>Thanks Ashok!

                        Ashok was the first person to join the Tesla AI/Autopilot team and ultimately rose to lead all AI/Autopilot software.

                        Without him and our awesome team, we would just be another car company looking for an autonomy supplier that doesnâ€™t exist.

                        Btw, I never suggested that he say anything and I had no idea he wrote this until I saw it 10 mins ago!</p>
